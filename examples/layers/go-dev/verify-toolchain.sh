# Post-install sanity for the go-dev image. Runs both standalone and
# from examples/layers/go-dev/Dockerfile.
#
# It invokes every tool as the guest PATH resolves it (bare name, not an
# absolute path), so a tool missing from the Dockerfile's ENV PATH fails the
# build here rather than surfacing as command-not-found in the guest. Beyond
# the versions, each tool analyses a real throwaway module: `go` builds, vets
# and race-tests it (the race run is also what proves the C toolchain is
# usable, since `-race` needs cgo), `gofmt` must report it formatted,
# `golangci-lint` lints it, and `gopls check` reports its diagnostics. A binary
# that prints a version but cannot analyse code -- a truncated download, a
# missing shared library, a module-cache misconfiguration -- fails the build.
#
# HOME/GOCACHE/GOPATH point at a temporary tree so the smoke module's build
# cache is not baked into the image (the guest gets its own, under its own
# persistent home).
#
# Environment:
#   GO_VERSION              required; the exact channel the layer installed
#   GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION   required; the release the layer installed
#   GOPLS_VERSION           required; the module version the layer installed
