# Install the pinned Go toolchain from go.dev, verifying the per-architecture
# SHA-256 before extracting. Runs both standalone (as root on a Debian/Ubuntu
# host) and from examples/layers/go-dev/Dockerfile, which passes the pin, the
# per-architecture digests and the install prefix as build args.
#
# Environment:
#   GO_VERSION       required; the exact release without the "go" prefix (e.g. 1.27.1)
#   GO_AMD64_SHA256  required on amd64; sha256 of go<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
#   GO_ARM64_SHA256  required on arm64; sha256 of go<version>.linux-arm64.tar.gz
#   GO_PREFIX        default /opt/go
#
# The install is world-readable: the guest may run as an
# arbitrary non-root uid. GOROOT is not set here or exported by the Dockerfile:
# the toolchain's own layout is self-locating, and unsetting it keeps a
# project-level `toolchain` directive from colliding with the environment.
