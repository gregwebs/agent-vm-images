# Shared recipe-contract helper: a classified download.
#
# Canonical source: images/recipe-contract/download.sh
# Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.
#
# Usage: download.sh URL OUTPUT
#
# Fetch URL into OUTPUT with curl. A *transport* failure is classified: the
# helper writes a machine-readable receipt and exits 75 so the owning installer
# can soften it when AGENT_INSTALL_SOFT_FAIL is set. Everything else -- an HTTP
# error such as 404, a malformed/unsafe URL, a local write error, or a curl
# code that is not a known transport failure -- is hard (exit 1), because it is
# not evidence that the network was briefly unavailable.
#
# The receipt path comes from AGENT_VM_TRANSPORT_RECEIPT (set by run-install.sh).
# It is cleared at the start of every attempt so a later unrelated failure can
# never consume an earlier attempt's receipt.
