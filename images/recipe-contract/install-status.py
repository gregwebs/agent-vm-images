"""Shared recipe-contract helper: per-slot install status records.

Canonical source: images/recipe-contract/install-status.py
Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.

Isolated low-level verifiers accept a missing command only with a fresh,
strictly valid `absent-transport CODE` record for development/audit behavior.
The maintained standard final gate requires every record to be `installed`.
This helper owns the strict parsing and path-state predicates:

  path-state PATH
      Exit 0 when PATH is GENUINELY absent -- every existing ancestor is a real
      directory and the leaf itself has no directory entry. Exit 1 when anything
      is present-but-broken: a regular file, a directory, a dangling symlink
      (the link itself is a directory entry), an ancestor that is a non-directory
      (ENOTDIR) or a dangling ancestor symlink. Exit 2 when lstat fails for any
      other reason (a permission error on an ancestor, a symlink loop). A
      present-but-unusable or broken path must never be waved away by an absence
      record, so only exit 0 authorises the absence branch.

  code FILE
      Print the CODE of a strictly valid record and exit 0. The record must be
      exactly one newline-terminated line `absent-transport CODE` with a CODE
      from the classified transport vocabulary. Anything else -- the line inside
      a malformed multi-line record, no trailing newline, `installed`, `pending`,
      or an unknown code -- exits 1.

  record FILE
      Print the whole record if it is one of the known exact records
      (`installed`, `pending`, `absent-transport CODE`, `absent-pi`); else 1.
