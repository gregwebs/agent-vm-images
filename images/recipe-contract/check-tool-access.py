"""Shared recipe-contract helper: the T5 "usable by any uid" command audit.

Canonical source: images/recipe-contract/check-tool-access.py
Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.

Usage: check-tool-access.py [--content] TARGET [TARGET ...]

Each TARGET is a bare command name (resolved on PATH) or a path. Resolves the
path component by component, following symlinks, and requires the *all-class*
predicate on every path that must be traversed:

  * every directory, including `/`, satisfies (mode & 0o111) == 0o111, so a
    0701 directory that denies a non-owner in its group, or a 0001 executable
    that denies its owner, both fail;
  * the final target is a regular file with (mode & 0o111) == 0o111;
  * if the final target is a script (a `#!` shebang), its content is
    (mode & 0o444) == 0o444 and its shebang interpreter is audited the same way.
    The shebang is split the way the Linux kernel splits it: the interpreter is
    the path up to the first space/tab, and the remainder (trailing spaces/tabs
    removed) is passed to it as ONE argument. For `/usr/bin/env` that argument
    is the command name unless it is an `-S` split-string; `sh -e` names the
    (nonexistent) program `sh -e`, never `sh` with option `-e`. A `PATH`
    assignment (only reachable through `-S`) selects the effective PATH the
    interpreter is resolved under (or the auditor's PATH when it makes none);
    lookup-changing options we do not model are rejected rather than skipped.

With `--content`, instead of the executable predicate the final target only has
to be readable by all ((mode & 0o444) == 0o444) and no shebang interpreter is
resolved. That is how a recipe audits required *data* it ships (a bridge source,
a mandatory extension) whose ancestors must still be traversable by every uid.

This is deliberately stricter than "other execute": Unix permission selection
does not fall through from owner/group to other, so only all-class bits prove
access for *any* uid/gid. A present-but-unsuitable command is a failure; a later
PATH candidate is never substituted for it. Dangling and cyclic links and
non-regular final targets are rejected. Symlink permission bits themselves are
ignored (the kernel does not consult them); the target and both the lexical and
resolved ancestors are audited. Control characters are never treated as
whitespace (a CRLF shebang names `/bin/sh\\r`, which does not exist).

A POSIX access ACL on any audited path is rejected: st_mode cannot prove it does
not grant an arbitrary uid more than the mode bits suggest.
