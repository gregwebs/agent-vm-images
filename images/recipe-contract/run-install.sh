# Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.
#
# Usage: run-install.sh NAME RESULT_FILE INTERPRETER SCRIPT [ARG ...]
#
# Runs `INTERPRETER SCRIPT [ARG ...]` (arguments are argv, never eval) and
# normalises its exit status:
#
#   0           -> 0   success
#   anything    -> 1   hard failure
#
# The classified-transport protocol (exit 75 + a fresh receipt) is handled by
# the *owning* hook (SCRIPT), which alone knows which partial artifacts are
# recipe-owned and may soften a failure when AGENT_INSTALL_SOFT_FAIL is set.
# run-install.sh guarantees that a raw 75 -- a classified transport the owning
# hook declined to soften, or a native subprocess that happened to exit 75 --
# can never escape as success.
#
# It also owns two shared mechanics:
#   * a private mktemp receipt path exported as AGENT_VM_TRANSPORT_RECEIPT, so
#     download.sh/run-npm.sh have one home for a classified failure;
#   * the RESULT_FILE status record, written `pending` before the attempt so an
#     inherited `installed` from an earlier layer cannot mask a failed install.
