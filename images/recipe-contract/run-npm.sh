# Shared recipe-contract helper: a classified `npm` invocation.
#
# Canonical source: images/recipe-contract/run-npm.sh
# Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.
#
# Usage: run-npm.sh RESULT_FILE -- npm <args...>
#
# Runs `npm <args...> --json --loglevel=error` under a 600s bound (TERM, then a
# KILL escalation so a TERM-ignoring npm cannot hang the build), capturing
# stdout (the JSON report, also written to RESULT_FILE) and stderr separately.
# The argv after `--` is the FULL command ("npm ci …"): this helper does not
# prepend `npm` itself, so the usage line and every caller agree. Exit 0 is
# success. A nonzero exit is classified as a *transport* failure -- the only
# case the owning installer may soften -- only when BOTH hold:
#
#   * the process exited normally (not killed by timeout/signal);
#   * stdout is exactly one JSON object whose `.error.code` is one of
#     EAI_AGAIN, ENOTFOUND, ECONNREFUSED, ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT; and
#   * every structured `npm error code <CODE>` line on stderr repeats that same
#     code (or there is none).
#
# Everything else -- unparseable/multiple/absent error objects, a contradictory
# stderr code, EINTEGRITY, E401, E404, ERESOLVE, a timeout or a signal -- is a
# hard failure. The classification is written to the receipt from
# AGENT_VM_TRANSPORT_RECEIPT (cleared at the start of the attempt) and the exit
# is 75; the owning hook decides whether to soften it.
