#!/bin/sh
# Shared recipe-contract helper: bounded, status-preserving command execution.
#
# Canonical source: images/recipe-contract/run-report.sh
# Bind-mounted directly by images/standard/Dockerfile; no tool-local copies.
#
# Usage: run-report.sh SECONDS STDOUT_FILE STDERR_FILE EXECUTABLE [ARG ...]
#
# Runs EXECUTABLE under `timeout SECONDS` with a private HOME/XDG scratch, so a
# tool that writes a config, prompts, or hangs cannot touch the image or the
# build. `--kill-after` follows the initial TERM with a KILL, so a tool that
# ignores TERM (or a descendant that does) bounds the run instead of hanging
# the build. Returns 0 only on execution status 0. Timeout, a signal, or any
# nonzero status is a failure; stdout and stderr stay in the named files for the
# owning hook to parse and to report. 75 is remapped to 1 so a tool that happens
# to exit 75 can never be mistaken for a classified transport failure.
#
# A bare command name is resolved against PATH with lstat semantics and the
# FIRST existing candidate is the one run -- a present-but-unusable candidate is
# reported, never skipped for a later executable. Absence is NOT classified
# here; a caller that allows a missing command must test for that itself.
