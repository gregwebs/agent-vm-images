# Bump the pinned dsh (and optionally pnpm) version: rewrite package.json's
# pin, update package-lock.json, and move the Dockerfile's LABEL fallback in
# lockstep. See images/tools/README.md ("The pinned lockfile layers") for why
# the lock matters here.
#
# Host-side only. The Dockerfile neither COPYs nor bind-mounts this file, so it
# never reaches the image. Run it as `bash upgrade-dsh.sh`: like every file under
# images/tools/ it is committed 0644 and run with `bash` (the recipes
# bind-mount their scripts rather than COPYing them with the execute bit).
#
# This is the DEVELOPER-only path. It resolves a dist-tag at the host seam, then
# calls the shared prepare-lock.sh with `--refresh-lock`, which keeps today's
# INCREMENTAL update (the committed lock is the starting point, so unrelated
# transitive pins do not move) and runs the pin/integrity/layout invariants but
# deliberately skips the build-mode location freeze: a reviewed transitive
# refresh is the point of a bump. Ordinary builds never pass that flag.
#
# Everything is staged in a scratch directory and only copied over the committed
# files once every check below passes, so a failed run leaves the working tree
# untouched.

Usage: bash images/tools/dsh/upgrade-dsh.sh [VERSION] [--pnpm PNPM_VERSION]

Pin ${PACKAGE} to VERSION, an exact version or a dist-tag (default: the
registry's \`latest\` dist-tag), and update package.json + package-lock.json
beside this script. pnpm keeps its current pin unless --pnpm is given
(\`--pnpm latest\` resolves the dist-tag).
