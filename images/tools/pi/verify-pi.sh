# Build-time verification gate for the pinned Pi layer, run from the layer's
# final `RUN --mount=type=bind` (see images/standard/Dockerfile). Bind-mounted,
# never COPYed, so the script stays out of the shipped image and needs no
# execute bit.
#
# It is reached in BOTH outcomes of install-pi.sh: a hard install failure
# already aborted the build, and a softened transport failure exited 0 having
# deleted /opt/agent-vm/pi entirely and recorded `absent-transport CODE`. The
# `! -x` branch below accepts that degraded state ONLY with a fresh absence
# record; otherwise a missing command is a hard failure regardless of
# AGENT_INSTALL_SOFT_FAIL.
#
# Every Pi invocation is bounded and its status is checked BEFORE its output is
# parsed: a command that prints the expected version/marker and then exits
# nonzero, or hangs, fails. The version contract is the committed manifest, and
# the bridge is checked by manifest-to-installed package.json equality PLUS a
# behavioral provider/models probe (metadata alone is not proof a working
# extension). On full success both slots are recorded `installed`; a
# bridge-only transport degradation leaves a working Pi `installed` and the
# bridge `absent-transport CODE`, never `installed`.
#
# All paths are explicit seams (production defaults asserted by the tests); the
# hermetic black-box test points every one at a case temp root.
