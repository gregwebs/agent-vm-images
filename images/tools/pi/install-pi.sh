# images/tools/pi/package-lock.json and images/tools/README.md).

# Runs inside the recipe-contract envelope (run-install.sh), so
# AGENT_VM_TRANSPORT_RECEIPT names a fresh private receipt. `npm ci` and the
# sibling re-fetches go through the classified adapters (run-npm.sh /
# download.sh): only a positively classified transport failure with that fresh
# receipt may be softened, and then only when AGENT_INSTALL_SOFT_FAIL is
# non-empty -- the image then ships without pi and records the absence. An
# integrity mismatch or a malformed lock is never soft-failable, and lock
# preparation failures are always hard.

    # resolution from inside pi-ai/dist) would never be looked at. The one
    # legitimate difference is that npm also installs this sibling's own
    # transitive dependencies under its `node_modules`; those are exactly the
    # root-relative nested dependency directories the committed lock declares
    # for this sibling, and npm authenticated them (they carry `integrity` in
    # Pi's shrinkwrap). Fold the declared directories into the extraction from
    # the installed tree, then require a plain `diff -r` to be empty. Any other
    # extra file, directory or symlink -- a shadow `node_modules` at a path the
    # lock does not declare, a tampered shipped file, a missing one -- fails.
    # Only the SHALLOWEST declared directories are folded. A lock can declare
    # a dependency nested inside another declared one (npm's shrinkwrap layout
    # can nest), and folding the ancestor copies its whole subtree -- including
    # any declared descendant -- from the installed tree. Folding the descendant
    # again would find it already present in the extraction and trip the
    # "tarball already contains" guard below with a misleading message. Drop any
    # rel that has an ancestor in the declared set; the ancestor's wholesale
    # `cp -a` covers it and `diff -r` still compares the whole subtree.
