# No Docker and no real Pi: the wrapper (`$WRAPPER`) and the installed entry
# point (`$PI_PREFIX/node_modules/.bin/pi`) are fakes under a case temp root, so
# every branch -- a missing installer with/without an absence record, the wrong
# version, the print-then-nonzero trap, a mismatching subcommand allowlist, the
# mandatory extension, a real (rpc) invocation that exits nonzero, the
# bridge's manifest/installed/probe gates, and the bridge-only degradation -- is
# exercised hermetically. jq, `timeout`, python3, the real run-report.sh/`jq`
# selectors and check-tool-access.py back the gate; both status records are
# written under the case temp root.
#
# The wrapper's `--help` subcommand list is compared against its own
# PI_SUBCOMMANDS line by the gate, so the fake keeps both in one place.
